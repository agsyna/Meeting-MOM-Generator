The **Meeting MOM Generator** is an AI-powered tool that automatically records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings.  
It identifies speakers, extracts key decisions and generates structured **Minutes of Meeting (MOM)** to simplify post-meeting documentation.

## Overview

Manual note-taking often results in missed information or inconsistent summaries.  
The Meeting MOM Generator automates this process using **speech recognition** and **speaker diarization** to produce accurate transcripts and concise summaries in real time.  

It ensures that all discussions, decisions and action items are accurately captured and easily accessible.

## How It Works

1. **Record Meeting**  
   The user records audio directly within the Flutter application.

2. **Process Audio**  
   The recorded audio is sent to the backend for processing.  
   Python-based models perform transcription and speaker diarization.

3. **Generate MOM**  
   The processed transcript is analyzed to extract key points, decisions, and action items.

4. **Display and Export**  
   The final transcript and MOM are displayed in the app and can be downloaded or shared.
